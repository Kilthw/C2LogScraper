# C2LogScraper
Scrapes Cobalt Strike logs for final customer deliverable.

Example: ./C2LogScraper.sh ~/share/Working/CS_Backups

This script works best if run against full cobaltstrike folder backups and requires that the exported TSVs be somewhere under the supplied cobaltstrike backup directory.
